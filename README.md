Repository for Summer 2025 research at Baylor University, mentored by Dr. Benton.

I will be researching macaque monkeys that self administer alcohol in order to further understand the effects of alcoholism on humans. With clinical chemistry data, I am interested
in clustering the monkeys in order to find patterns in each cluster's drinking habits. My summer project consists of creating various clustering models in order to compare which one
is the most accurate as well as how these models cluster the monkeys based on the biomarker features. I will be comparing the model's results to the monkey's drinking category from
the data. 

This research is done with the Monkey Alcohol Tissue Research Resource.
