Repository for summer 2025 research. 

I will be researching macaque monkeys that self-administer alcohol in order to further understand the effects of alcoholism on humans. With clinical chemistry data, I am interested in clustering the monkeys in order to find patterns in each cluster's drinking habits. I am also interested in using different machine learning models to attempt to predict biomarkers based on a monkey's drinking category, sex, species, and other characterisitcs.
