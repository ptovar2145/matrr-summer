This is a folder containing plots for a limited number of biomarkers for timepoints "baseline", "open access", "open access 1",
and "open access 2". 

This proved to be a problem because the timepoints labeled "open access" did not specify whether they were from the first or second
6 months of self administration of alcohol. The data needs further cleaning.
